#### Network Unreachable in Virtuablbox
Sometimes the virtual machines will be unable to use the local network to reach the gateway and go out to the public internet. This is often caused by incompatability issues with the physical wireless NIC. Wireless solution unknown. It appears that the only solution is to connect the host machine to the network with a cable.
This problem is so far only with Virtual Box.
