### SSH to remote hosts
- Install openssh: `sudo yum â€“y install openssh-server openssh-clients`
- To start ssh: `sudo systemctl start sshd`
- To check ssh status: `sudo systemctl status sshd`
- To stop ssh: `systemctl stop sshd`
- To enable ssh to start automatically after each system reboot by using the systemctl command: `sudo systemctl enable sshd`
- To disable ssh persistence after reboot enter: `sudo systemctl disable sshd`

#### Ssh server configuration is needed to harden server security. The most common settings to enhance security are changing the port number, disabling root logins, and limiting access to only certain users. To edit these settings access the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file: `sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
##### Disabling root logins and editing the default port number are good places to start.
- Disable root login: `PermitRootLogin no`
- Change the SSH port to run on a non-standard port. For example: `Port 2002`
##### Save the file after edits and restart sshd: `service ssh resart`

- To access a remote host type: `ssh ipaddress` or `ssh username@ipaddress`.
- Logging in to a remote machine with `ssh ipaddress' the remote machine will assume you intend to use the same username you are currently logged in as.
- Logging in as `ssh username@ipaddress` you will be prompted for the password of the user you are attempting to login as.
